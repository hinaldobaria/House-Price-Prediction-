# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The model is built using machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, with data sourced from the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the price of houses based on various factors. This can help potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make data-driven decisions. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of regression models.

## Features

- Predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and more.
- Data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Implementation of Linear Regression and Random Forest models for price prediction.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset.
- It includes features such as lot size, year built, number of rooms, and more.
- Target variable: SalePrice (the price of the house).

## Algorithms Used

- **Linear Regression:** A basic regression algorithm used to predict the continuous target variable.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Ensure the `requirements.txt` file includes necessary libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Usage

1. Prepare the data:
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory or adjust the file path in the code as needed.
   - Run the data preprocessing notebook/script to clean and prepare the data.

2. Train the models:
   - Use the provided notebooks/scripts to train the Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
   - Evaluate the models using the test set.

3. Predict house prices:
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.
   - Visualize the results using plots provided in the notebooks.

## Results

- The project achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of X and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of Y with the Random Forest model, which performed better than the Linear Regression model.
- Insights gained from feature importance analysis showed that features such as `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `GarageCars` had the most significant impact on house prices.
